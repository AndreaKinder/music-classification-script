# music-classification-script
[Espa√±ol](README.md) | English
---
Bash script for music classification based on directories: artist/album.
This script first attempts to search the metadata of the MP3 file and, if it doesn't find the data, prompts the user.
*The name "$user" must be changed to the actual username that the directory is part of.*
